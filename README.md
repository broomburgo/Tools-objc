# Tools-objc
Tools to simplify manipulation of some ObjC types.

Please don't use this.
Read it, learn from it, puke on it if you need to, but don't use it as-it-is: write a new version from scratch, think about better abstractions, make it yours.

Please don't outsource knowledge, you'll regret it.
